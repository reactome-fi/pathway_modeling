 * This package is an new clean re-implementation of PARADGIM for Reactome pathways without using the data structure
 * from libdai. However, the final inference based on libdai may still be used for classes in this package before
 * a pure Java-based implementation for all algorithms can be implemented. Classes in package org.reactome.paradigm
 * should be deprecated.
